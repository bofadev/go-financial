A golang backend project with react front end. Meant to demonstrate my understanding and ability to create fullstack web applications. Setup to deploy on heroku.

## Intents

Design a golang RESTful backend service that
* Serves web requests
* Accepts data writes
* Provides data reads
* Houses a peristed database (memory/disk)
* Has clear interfacing between between database use and actual database implementation
** Makes mocking functionality via some fake easy
** Makes it possible to use any number of actual database implementations without affecting logic accessing the database
* Use value/reference intentionally
** Avoid data copying where desirable to
* Assume someone who will never meet me needs to work with the code
** As self documenting as possible.
** Clear error logging.
* Deploy on heroku
** Conserve efforts to spend on the project work and not on hosting
** Reliable
* Use a clean and light weight frontend UI: Bulma
* Use as few React features as necessary
* Use as many out-of-the-box frontend features to provide input validation as possible
** Disabling buttons, input types
