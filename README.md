# go-financial
A golang backend project with react front end. Meant to demonstrate my understanding and ability to create fullstack web applications. Setup to deploy on heroku.

## Intents
Design a golang RESTful backend service that
* Serves web requests
* Accepts data writes
* Provides data reads
* Houses a peristed database (memory/disk)
* Has clear interfacing between between database use and actual database implementation
  * Makes mocking functionality via some fake easy
  * Makes it possible to use any number of actual database implementations without affecting logic accessing the database
* Uses value/reference intentionally
  * Avoid data copying where desirable to
* Assume someone who will never meet me needs to work with the code
  * As self documenting as possible
  * Clear error logging
* Uses testing and test reporting

Deploys on heroku
* Conserve efforts to spend on the project work and not on hosting
* Reliable

Design a front end that
* Uses a clean and light weight frontend UI: Bulma
* Uses as few React features as necessary
* Uses as many out-of-the-box frontend features to provide input validation as possible
  * Disabling buttons, input types
